[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is a powerful tool that allows you to add [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to your project. These hooks can be used to run scripts or commands before or after certain Git actions, such as committing changes or pushing commits to a remote repository. [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#what-is-commitlint) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#readme) are two popular tools that can be used in conjunction with Husky to enforce code quality and formatting standards in your Angular project.

In this article, we will install **Husky**, **Commitlint** and **Lint-staged** in an **Angular v15** project.

## Prerequisites
Before to start you will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Angular **requires an active LTS (Long Term Support) or maintenance LTS version** of **Node.js**.
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): We will use the **Angular CLI** to create an Angular project.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The editor to add a new component inside the project. (You can choose your favourite editor or IDE as well 🙂)


## Create an Angular project
Let's create a new project with the Angular CLI by running the following command in a terminal:
```powershell
ng new angular-husky
``` 
After running the command, Angular CLI will ask you few questions to configure your new Angular project:
![Create new Angular project](/img/angular-husky-create-new-project.png)

Then go inside the project with the command:
```powershell
cd .\angular-husky\
```

And open the project with Visual Studio Code:
```powershell
code .
``` 

If all has gone well so far, you should have the following architecture:

## Install Husky
Now, we will install Husky in our project.

To do this, run the following command:
```powershell
npm install husky --save-dev
```

> **_Note:_**  The `--save-dev` option will install Husky as devDependency as the application does not need Husky to run.

Then let's activate the hooks with the following command:
```powershell
npx husky install
```

To automatically have Git hooks enabled after install, run the following command:
```powershell
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky install"
```

This command will add a new script inside the package.json file:
```json
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
```
## Install commitlint
Next, we will install commitlint, which is a tool that enforces commit message conventions. To install commitlint, run the following command:
```powershell
npm install @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional --save-dev
```


## Configure commitlint
After installing commitlint, we will need to configure it to enforce commit message conventions in our project. Therefore, let's create a **commitlint.config.js** file at the root of the project:
```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
};
```

Now let's add our Git hook with Husky:
```powershell
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg  'npx --no -- commitlint --edit ${1}'
```

The command will create a new commit-msg hook in our project's .husky directory, which runs commitlint to validate the commit message according to the configured rules.

Let's test to make sure it works:
![Commit message error](/img/angular-husky-commit-message-error.png)

As we can see, it is not possible to commit if the message does not respect the [convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint).


## Install lint-staged
Now that we have installed and configured Husky and commitlint, we will install lint-staged, which is a tool that allows us to run tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) on staged files.

To install lint-staged, run the following command:
```powershell
npm install lint-staged --save-dev
``` 

> **_Note:_**  If you don't know how to install ESLint and Prettier in an Angular project, you can take a look to these articles: 
> 
> - [Configure ESLint with Angular](https://www.blouppy.com/blog/2023-04-03-configure-eslint-with-angular/)
> - [Configure Prettier with Angular](https://www.blouppy.com/blog/2023-01-29-configure-prettier-with-angular/)


## Configure lint-staged
After installing lint-staged, we will configure it to run the linters on staged files. Therefore, create a new file named **.lintstagedrc.js** in the root of the project and add the following code:
```json
{
   "*.{ts, html}": [
      "eslint --fix"
    ],
   "*.{json,css,scss,less,md,ts,html}": [
      "prettier --write"
   ]
}
``` 

Finally, we can configure Husky to run lint-staged:

```powershell
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit  'npx lint-staged'
```

This command will create a new pre-commit hook in our project's .husky directory, which runs lint-staged to format files and check for linting errors.

Now, if we commit one or more files, **Husky will first run the pre-commit hook**, which will **execute lint-staged**. If there are any issues found, the commit will be **aborted**.

Assuming lint-staged passes, **Husky will then run the commit-msg hook**. **The commit message will then be validated by commitlint**. If the commit message fails validation, the commit will be **aborted**.

If both hooks pass, **the commit will be created and the changes will be added to the Git repository**.

That's it! We have successfully configured Husky with commitlint and lint-staged for your Angular project. 🙂

## Conclusion
In this article, we have learned how to set up Husky with commitlint and lint-staged for an Angular project. By using Husky, we can run the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks to enforce our code quality and commit message conventions in our project.

In addition, Husky can be used for a variety of use cases beyond those mentioned here. For example, it is also possible to use Husky to run tests before committing your changes or to run a script in a pre-push hook.

I hope you found this article useful! 👍
