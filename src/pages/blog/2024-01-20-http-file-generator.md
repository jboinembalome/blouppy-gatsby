Testing and exploring REST APIs is a daily task for most developers. While tools like Postman and Insomnia are popular choices, the lightweight `.http` file format — natively supported by Visual Studio and the REST Client extension for VS Code — offers a frictionless alternative that lives right alongside your source code.

**HTTP File Generator** is a web application I built to automate this workflow: upload your OpenAPI specification, browse and select the endpoints you care about, preview the generated `.http` content, and download a ZIP archive — all in your browser, with no data ever leaving your machine.


## What is a .http File?

A `.http` file is a plain-text file that contains one or more HTTP requests. Each request specifies the HTTP method, URL, headers, and optional body. Here is a simple example:

```http
### Get all products
GET https://api.example.com/products
Content-Type: application/json

### Create a product
POST https://api.example.com/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Widget",
  "price": 9.99
}
```

These files can be executed directly inside **Visual Studio** (via the built-in HTTP editor) or in **Visual Studio Code** with the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension. No extra tooling is needed — just open the file and click **Send Request**.


## Why HTTP File Generator?

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications can contain dozens or even hundreds of endpoints. Writing `.http` files by hand for each endpoint is tedious and error-prone. HTTP File Generator solves this by:

- **Parsing your spec automatically** — supports `.json`, `.yaml`, and `.yml` OpenAPI 3.x files.
- **Letting you select only what you need** — browse endpoints by tag or HTTP method, filter with a real-time search, and check only the endpoints you want to test.
- **Giving you a live preview** — the generated `.http` content updates instantly as you make selections.
- **Generating a well-organised ZIP** — the downloaded archive contains one `.http` file per tag or path group, mirroring the structure of your API.


## How to Use It

### Step 1 – Upload Your Spec

Navigate to [HTTP File Generator](https://github.com/Blouppy/http-file-generator) and drag-and-drop your OpenAPI specification file (`.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`) onto the upload area, or click to browse your file system.

The file is parsed entirely in the browser using [`@apidevtools/swagger-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apidevtools/swagger-parser). **Your spec is never sent to any server.**


### Step 2 – Select Endpoints

Once the spec is loaded, you are taken to the selection screen. The endpoint list is grouped by tag and shows the HTTP method, path, and summary for each operation.

You can:
- **Filter by HTTP method** — show only `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
- **Filter by tag** — focus on a specific area of the API.
- **Use the search bar** — type any keyword to narrow the list in real time.
- **Select all / deselect all** — quickly pick or drop an entire group.

The **live preview panel** on the right updates every time you toggle an endpoint, so you always see exactly what will be generated.


### Step 3 – Download

Click **Download** to receive a ZIP archive. Inside, you will find one `.http` file per tag or path group, ready to open in Visual Studio or VS Code.

If you only need a quick copy-paste, the **Copy** button copies the entire preview to your clipboard.


## Tech Stack

HTTP File Generator is built with modern web technologies:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui |
| OpenAPI Parsing | `@apidevtools/swagger-parser` |
| ZIP Generation | `jszip` + `file-saver` |
| Testing | Jest + `@testing-library/react` |
| E2E Testing | Playwright |


## Running Locally

If you want to run the project locally or contribute, the setup is straightforward:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blouppy/http-file-generator.git
cd http-file-generator
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server starts at `http://localhost:3000`. You can run the unit tests with `npm test` and the end-to-end tests (which require a production build) with `npm run test:e2e`.


## Conclusion

HTTP File Generator removes the friction of manually writing `.http` test files. Whether you are onboarding onto a new API, building a test suite, or simply exploring an existing service, just drop in your OpenAPI spec and get a ready-to-use archive in seconds.

The project is open-source and available on GitHub: [Blouppy/http-file-generator](https://github.com/Blouppy/http-file-generator).
