  Let's answer a common question that many C# developers ask themselves.

When we develop, we may use variables that are not modifiable.  
Sometimes we work with `const`, other times we use variables that are `readonly`. 
However, what are the differences between these two keywords from a technical point of view?  

## Const keyword
The `const` keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be modified after it has been initialized.

Below is an example of a `const` declaration:

```csharp
public class Colour
{
    public const string ConstRed = "#FF0000";
}
```

- By default, a `const` is `static`. This means that we can access to `ConstRed` without creating a new instance of `Colour`.
- A `const` can be declared in a method if needed unlike to a `readonly`.
- A `const` only accepts a value type, a string or a null value. Therefore, it is not possible to use a `const` for a `DateTime`.


## Readonly keyword
The `readonly` keyword is used to declare a variable which can only be initialized at the declaration time or in constructors.

Below is an example of a `readonly` declaration:

```csharp
public class Colour
{
    public readonly string ReadOnlyRed;

    public Colour()
    {
        ReadOnlyRed = "#FF0000";
    }

    public Colour(string red)
    {
        ReadOnlyRed = red;
    }
}
```

It is also possible to have a static field like this:

```csharp
public class Colour
{
    public static readonly string ReadOnlyRed = "#FF0000";
}
```

- A `readonly` can only be declared as a field. Therefore, it is not possible to have a `readonly` inside a method.
- A `readonly` accepts both value types and reference types. It is possible to modify the properties of an object that is in readonly but we cannot replace the object with another.


## Significant difference

A `const` is a compile time constant that is copied into every assembly that uses it, as opposed to a `readonly` which is a value at runtime. 

Let's take an example to understand this better.

Below we have a `Colour` class present in the Core DLL which is referenced by several applications.

```csharp
namespace Core
{
    public class Colour
    {
        public const string ConstRed = "#FF0000";
        public static readonly string ReadOnlyRed = "#FF0000";
    }
}
```

As we can see, the `Colour` class has a `const` and a `readonly` with the same value. 

Now let's look at the code of an application that uses the Core DLL.

```csharp
using Core;
using System;

namespace SampleConstVsReadonly
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Const value: {Colour.ConstRed}.");
            Console.WriteLine($"Readonly value:{Colour.ReadOnlyRed}.");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Once the application is compiled and run, we get the following result:

```bash:clipboard=false
Const value: #FF0000.
Readonly value:#FF0000.
```

Unfortunately, we are not satisfied with the red colour... As a result, we decide to modify the code of the `Colour` class which is in the DLL.

```csharp
namespace Core
{
    public class Colour
    {
        public const string ConstRed = "#EF4444";
        public readonly string ReadOnlyRed = "#EF4444";
    }
}
```

Now we compile the updated DLL. Since we haven't changed anything in the application, we simply replace the old DLL with the newer one without recompiling the application.

Next we restart the application to see the result:

```bash:clipboard=false
Const value: #FF0000.
Readonly value:#EF4444".
```

And as we can see, only the readonly is updated.

The reason for this is that when the application is compiled, the compiler replaces the `const` with its value to optimise the performance. 
However, the behaviour is different for `readonly` because the value is read at the runtime so every time we run the application.

To solve the `const` problem, simply recompile the application with the new DLL.

## Conclusion
The keywords `const` and `readonly` have some things in common but also some differences that can have an impact on our projects.
The `const` is a compile time and the `readonly` a runtime. 

If we want to update a constant that is in a DLL, 
we need to recompile all projects that reference that DLL to get the new value of the constant.

I hope I have helped you demystify the differences between `const` and `readonly`.
If not, I will be happy to exchange with you in comments! üëç
