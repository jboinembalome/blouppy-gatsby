### Beginning of Programmation
I started programming when I was working at ETAI as an apprentice. With only a few purely theoretical principles, I asked myself how a developer could create software. And it was here that I created my first... "Hello World!". For an experienced developer, a simple "Hello World!" is not a revolutionary thing.
However, as a beginner, I found it incredible! 

It was with this simple application that I discovered my passion and went on to higher education while developing with pleasure in my free time.

### Tool Used
Here is the list of tools I usually use:
- Visual Studio 2019 (Migration to 2022 soon)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash (Also Git in VS 2019 and VS Code)
- Postman
- Docker Desktop (Sometimes)

### Hardware
I am working on a Dell XPS 15 (9510) Core i7 11th generation with 1TB and 32GB of RAM.
In addition, this laptop is connected to two Dell UltraSharp 27 (U2719D) monitors.

### Thank You
In conclusion, thank you simply for taking the time to read about me.
