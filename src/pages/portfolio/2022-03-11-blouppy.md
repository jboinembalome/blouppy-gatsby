Blouppy is the current website. It was created with Gatsby and deployed with Netifly. I wanted to have my own personal blog site and Steve Smith aka Ardalis, whom I thank, had shared an article about it. All the conditions were there for me to get started and it allowed me to do a little React and discover Gatsby and Netifly. TailwindCSS, TaiwindUI and Headless UI were used for styling.
