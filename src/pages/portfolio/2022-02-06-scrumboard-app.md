Scrumboard is a Trello clone built with Angular 12 and ASP.NET Core 5. This project was made to provide an example of an enterprise project that changes from the "Todo" application we often see. The front end is made with Angular Material and TaiwindCSS and the back end Scrumboard is based on Clean Architecture, MediatR, Entity Framework Core, Identity Server and AutoMapper.
