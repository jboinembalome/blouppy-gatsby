Project allowing me to improve my knowledge in Angular 12 and ASP.NET Core 5. WordCities allows to have a CRUD on a list of countries and cities which are stored in a CSV file then inserted in a database. A pagination system is also included and a form with back end and front end validation. For the back end the project is also based on MediatR, Entity Framework Core, Identity Server and AutoMapper.
